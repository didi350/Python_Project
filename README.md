# Welcome!

This is a Python project created with Jupyter Notebook. The project goal is to find out which profiles (categories or genres) of apps are popular on Google Play and the iOS App Store, for a company that wants to develop a new free English-based app. Their main revenue comes from in-app ads, which is why the focus is placed on the apps' popularity as a proxy for the number of potential ad viewers.

The project code is within Python_File. The Notebook covers everything, including explanations, tables, conclusions, and some extra sections at the end. There are multiple images and functions created for this project, which are grouped under their corresponding folders. The database consists of 2 main CSV files, grouped with the corresponding licences under the "Database" folder. Both of the datasets were sourced from Kaggle; please see the Sources section at the bottom of the notebook to get to the links.

Thanks for coming around!
